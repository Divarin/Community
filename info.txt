If you have any texts that you'd like to upload, whether they be something you wrote yourself (fan fiction, instructions/tutorials, bits and pieces of a novel you've had floating around in your mind, magazines or 'e-zines' etc...) then please do!  

If you want your own textfiles area to upload your texts so that they don't have to just go into "misc. texts" just ask me (the sysop) and I'll create it for you.  Also if you want me to copy your texts to the text files area off the main menu (G) then let me know and I will.
