If you&apos;re using one that supports ANSI, even if only 40 columns, such as Striketerm, there is another IRC gateway on Mutiny under (X) Games & More -&gt; Internet -&gt; IRC.  This one doesn&apos;t freak out like the synchronet built in one does.  I tested this on my commodore, it does require ansi but only for color codes it doesn&apos;t keep trying to reposition the cursor and redrawing the status line like the synchronet one does.  I have to configure what servers you can connect to so I put in 4 for now (Afternet, EFNet, Slashnet, and Undernet) but if you want to get to another network let me know and I&apos;ll add it.</span></div>

I grew up in the shadow of the Hanford site (which was a part of the manhattan project) and the city I grew up in was (and still is) focussed on cleaning up all the waste on the site.  It sounds bad but the thing is I&apos;ve been out on that site and it&apos;s like a wildlife heaven.  The damage done by building streets, shopping centers, industries, etc. is way worse than groundwater polution from leaking nuclear waste.  </span></div>
