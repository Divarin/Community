You can post whatever predictions you want and can be as specific or general as you want the only stipulation I ask is that it be for next year, so if you&apos;re posting in 2022 then the prediction should be about 2023, if you&apos;re posting in 2023 then it should be for 2024 etc...  Doesn&apos;t have to be 365 days away, you can post a prediction about 1/1/2023 on 12/31/2022 if you want :)</span></div>
<div id='chat5030' class='chat'><span class='chatHead'>[Predictions] [22-10-05 13:34] &lt;<span class='chatUser'>Divarin</span>&gt; re: - </span><span class='chatBody'>So to get things started here&apos;s a prediction:  I predict that in 2023 we will see a subtle change in the entertainment industry.  What I think will happen is that the trend of rehashing old shit will start to taper off and we&apos;ll start to see some new stories being told either in movies or shows.  I think the budgets will be smaller so fewer special effects and greener actors but probably some new and interesting stories that aren&apos;t reboots of stuff from 20 years ago.  I still think the rehashing and rebooting will continue and will still be larger than the new stuff as companies pay a lot for that IP and want to milk it as much as they can but I also think they will be a little more willing, next year, to risk a little bit of money on some untried new stuff.</span></div>

For new users that don&apos;t know there are other channels, use /chl to list them.  Also anyone can create a channel you don&apos;t need to be a sysop or anything.  I guess it&apos;s not that obvious because most BBSs are like "what has the sysop provided" whereas here channels, text files, and even doors can be created by users.</span></div>
