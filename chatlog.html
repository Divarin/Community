You can post whatever predictions you want and can be as specific or general as you want the only stipulation I ask is that it be for next year, so if you&apos;re posting in 2022 then the prediction should be about 2023, if you&apos;re posting in 2023 then it should be for 2024 etc...  Doesn&apos;t have to be 365 days away, you can post a prediction about 1/1/2023 on 12/31/2022 if you want :)</span></div>
<div id='chat5030' class='chat'><span class='chatHead'>[Predictions] [22-10-05 13:34] &lt;<span class='chatUser'>Divarin</span>&gt; re: - </span><span class='chatBody'>So to get things started here&apos;s a prediction:  I predict that in 2023 we will see a subtle change in the entertainment industry.  What I think will happen is that the trend of rehashing old shit will start to taper off and we&apos;ll start to see some new stories being told either in movies or shows.  I think the budgets will be smaller so fewer special effects and greener actors but probably some new and interesting stories that aren&apos;t reboots of stuff from 20 years ago.  I still think the rehashing and rebooting will continue and will still be larger than the new stuff as companies pay a lot for that IP and want to milk it as much as they can but I also think they will be a little more willing, next year, to risk a little bit of money on some untried new stuff.</span></div>

For new users that don&apos;t know there are other channels, use /chl to list them.  Also anyone can create a channel you don&apos;t need to be a sysop or anything.  I guess it&apos;s not that obvious because most BBSs are like "what has the sysop provided" whereas here channels, text files, and even doors can be created by users.</span></div>

She has been taking the over the counter stuff but it&apos;s pretty low dose because bad things can happen if you have too much potassium as well and there really isn&apos;t a good at-home test you can do to know what your level is at.

Added /times (synonyms: /date, /dates, /when).  This command shows you the current time in UTC, at Community (in Cleveland), and for each active session (so you can tell what time it is for other users if they&apos;ve used the /tz command to set their time zone).  Also shows connection time for each session and uptime for the BBS (same as the /uptime command).</span></div>

And I try to help out whenever I can, albiet I&apos;m still at the stage where I need help more than I can help when it comes to electronics.  The loss of community on YouTube is probably due to people trying to make YouTube a job and relying on that as their primary (or only) income. Now you have to chance the algorithm and you view fellow youtubers more as competition than friends.</span></div>

I have SOOO many videos about Star Trek I&apos;m going to recommend all of them to you from now on and the hell with anything you actually want to watch!"  I made that mistake with one Simpsons video once, had to spend like 30 minutes clicking "not interested" until it finally got the hint.

True there are still bigots and racists and they are getting louder but when I step away from my phone and my computer and talk to real people (on a plane, on the train, at work, anywhere) I find that the vast majority of the people out there are worried about these people rather than being these people.  I believe that the echo chambers of social media has made the hate-filled ideas these people have grow stronger and they are now more than ever feeling free to shout their hated rather than keep it to themselves.  The "show me the things I like, ignore the things I don&apos;t" algorithms have strengthened all kinds of bullshit ideas that once would live silently in the backs of an unhealthy mind, things like vaccines are causing autism, we staged the moon landing, the earth is flat, and of course old bigotry that takes generations to die.  On top of this the world is just becoming a harder place to live because the economic system is based on growth and growth is not infinately sustainable (it doesn&apos;t matter how insanely rich a company is, the shareholders demand that it, somehow, become EVEN RICHER next year).  So this causes a lot of problems, and people who already may have preconceived (or inherited) ideas about other people, whether they be of a different race, different sex, or different lifestyle, will point the finger at them and say "it&apos;s all their fault, they&apos;re making things shitty".  Then there goes the echo-chamber confirming their suspicions.</span></div>
