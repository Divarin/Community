*** textfiles browser ***

NOTE: the space between the command and it's option number is optional.  Spaces will be used in this document 
for brevity but know that "read4" and "read 4" will both work as is the case with other similar commands.

command line interface similar to dos/*nix
use dir/ls to list directory contents
'ls' or 'dir /w' shows only filenames, in wide format:
(1) [subdir1]        (2) [subdir2]       (3) [subdir3]
(4) somefile.txt     (5) otherfil.txt    (6) anotherf.txt
(7) yetmore.txt      (8) evenmore.txt

'dir' shows files in long format:
  1: [subdir1]    - description of subdir
  2: [subdir2]    - description of subdir
  3: [subdir3]    - description of subdir
  4: somefile.txt - As much content of the description of the file th...
  5: otherfil.txt - at will fit on the remainder of the line.
  6: anotherf.txt - and so on...
  
at prompt, entering just the number will 
1) show full description
2a) if it's a dir ask "change to this directory (y/n)"
2b) if it's a file ask "read this file (y/n)"

this "describe first, then confirm before continuing" can be bypassed by:
a) if it's a dir use "cd 1" where '1' is the number, or "cd name" where 'name' is the subdir name
   NOTE: 'cd..' or 'cd ..' can be used to go up one level, 'cd/' or 'cd /' or 'cd\' or 'cd \' can return
   you to the top level
b) if it's a file use "read 4" where '4' is the number.  Alternatives to the keyword 'read':
   type, more, less, cat, r (can use just 'r' instead of 'read')
   alternatively the commands 'nonstop' and 'ns' can be used to read the file without page pauses.
   
While reading a document when, when at a page pause "More? (y,n,c)" you can use Page Up or 'u' to cause 
the reader to redraw the previous page.  If you're at the "more" prompt at the bottom of page 2 then 
pressing Page Up or 'u' will re-display page 1.  If you're at the prompt at the bottom of page 1 then 
pressing this will re-display the same page (1) over again.

[Community integration]
the textfile browser is a subsection of community similar to the email or live chat events calendar subsections.  
That is, although you're connected to community and in some channel, you're also in a separate menu system.  
The effect of this is that you can see channel notifications (including new chat messages) but you can't respond to them 
until you leave the subsystem.

Unlike the calendar or email systems where you're not expected to be there for very long you might find yourself in the 
textfile browser for long periods of time, perhaps even just reading a single document for a long time.  

Therefore the "Do not Disturb" feature of community is automatically activated when entering the textfile browser, however 
you can use the command 'dnd' to toggle this.  This way you can still be notified if someone logs in or types a message 
while you're reading text files.

You can also use the command 'chat' (or 'c') to send a message to the channel:
txt /humor/JOKES>
Just Now: <soandso> hey dude, what's up?
txt /humor/JOKES>c not much dude, just reading some texts!
12345 Posted to [General]
txt /humor/JOKES>

You can also use the 'link' (or 'l') command to link to a textfiles directory or a file:
txt /humor/JOKES>dir
 1: 100.txt     - I'd Love To, But.........
 2: 100room.txt - 100 Ways to Freak Out Your Roommate
 ...
txt /humor/JOKES>link 2
<Jimbob> Check out the textfile '100room.txt' with the channel, use '/read 3025' to read this text file!
   This is entered into the chat as if you had typed it, therefore it also persists in the history and can be read by future users.  The link 
   is also persisted in the database so that others can follow it in the future.
txt /humor/JOKES>

You can, optionally, send the link to only one person by adding their name after the word 'link' (or 'l'):
txt /humor/JOKES>link soandso 2
Jimbob has shared the text file '100room.txt' with you, use '/read' to read this text file!
   Note, in this case, since the link was only sent to a single user, Jimbob, and that user had to be online at the time 
   there is no persistence here. The message is shown only to jimbob, not saved in the history, and the link has no persistence.
   The 'read' command that jimbob might use will only work during that session.  Also if you were to send jimbob another link then 
   then 'read' command will point to the new file and not the previous.
